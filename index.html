			<p class="session-text">For Guerrilla, Horizon Zero Dawn was a massive change in direction. Transitioning from the level-based, tactical, first person shooter genre to open world, action RPG required us to develop many new systems and to redesign existing ones. In this session we will describe the challenges we faced when developing the AI for Horizon Zero Dawn and the solutions we chose. Some of the subjects we will cover are navigation for agents of varying size in a dynamic environment, how we use a combination of HTN planning and utility based decision making, and the systems we developed to coordinate groups of agents.</p>
			<br>
			<h4 class="speaker-name">About Arjen Beij</h4>
			<p class="speaker-bio">	Arjen Beij decided at an early age that making games would be the best job in the world. After studying computer science at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam he joined Lost Boys Interactive in 1999, where he got the opportunity to develop his first commercially released games. Two years later he joined Guerrilla as an AI programmer where he worked on the AI for Killzone, Killzone 2, Killzone 3, Killzone Shadow Fall and Horizon Zero Dawn. For the past six years he has led the AI team at Guerrilla.</p>

She was Lead AI on multiple Assassin’s Creed games. Her passion for design has pushed her teams to think about why we are developing our games rather than just how we develop them. She empowers her teams to think outside of the box through game jams and experimentation. Recently she has made the jump from video games to Mixed Reality. Joining Magic Leap as Interaction Director for their new San Francisco office. Where her team focuses on finding new and innovative ways to create rich immersive experiences focused on player interaction and narrative. She is also an AI Summit advisor for GDC.

So, while in his past he shipped everything from a simple Sega Genesis jrpg to the international blockbuster Hearthstone at Blizzard, he now runs the Interaction Lab, a systems research group within Magic Leap. In addition to using crazy new hardware to explore interactions from low level to hugely complex, his team also helps bring compelling experience to the forefront of the Magic Leap engineering efforts. Throughout this, his mission has never changed: to find fun, interactive experiences and share them with the world.</p>

We present a hierarchical path planning algorithm for finding a progressively more detailed path between two points. Additionally, we will touch on some gameplay related subjects, to show the additional challenges we faced in implementing the different flying behaviors, such as transitioning from air to ground and guided crash-landing.</p>

			<p class="session-text">Reinforcement Learning (RL) has long been popular in academic research on game AI, but is much less commonly applied to AAA games. This talk will present an initiative within Ubisoft Montreal to use RL as a tool for game productions, by building agents that are able to play (parts of) the game during its development. Preliminary results for two applications will be shown: learning a fighting AI in For Honor to assist with game balancing and new character development, and learning a driving AI in Watch_Dogs to help reach realistic behavior with a large variety of vehicles. The talk will cover the challenges we faced when applying state-of-the-art RL algorithms to modern games, the main lessons learned, and how this project was actually helpful (or not) to designers, testers and programmers on the production floor. And, as a bonus, you may expect videos of games that look better than Pong or Doom for a change!</p>

			<h4 class="speaker-name">About Olivier Delalleau</h4>
			<p class="speaker-bio">Olivier is currently part of the analytics team in Ubisoft Montreal’s User Research Lab, where he can have fun with tons of player data to build machine learning models from. It took him a while to get there: after graduating from the Ecole Polytechnique de Paris (2001) and from the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Télécommunications de Paris (2003), he first worked as a research assistant at Université de Montréal. He then decided a Ph.D in machine learning could always be handy, so he started one, and even finished it when Ubisoft offered to hire him in 2012.</p>
			<h4 class="speaker-name">About Adrien Logut</h4>
			<p class="speaker-bio">Adrien is working at Ubisoft Montreal as an AI programmer and more precisely at La Forge, the R&D department, after two MEng (one in France and one in Montreal). His old passion for video games creation and his new one in AI offered him an opportunity to join Ubisoft in 2017. His latest work is in teaching AIs to play video games.</p>

			<p class="session-text">Our goal with Assassin's Creed Origins has been to modernize the franchise and reinventing our AI was a focal point towards reaching this objective. This challenged our team to deliver systems to make the citizens of Egypt feel like they have an agenda in the world beyond the Player. However, there are many challenges in both design and programming that we had to tackle to accomplish this goal. We had to find a way to make every AI do something coherent beyond player centric reactions at all time, make our reaction system adapt more based on what our AI previously experienced and make the search loop more about outsmarting a group rather singular AIs.</p>

			<p class="session-text">This presentation will cover the implementation of the AI teammates in the systemic open world of Ghost Recon Wildlands, in order for them to be reliable and engaging for the player. I’ll quickly introduce the mainly data-driven architecture before diving in the essentials systems ruling their behavior, designed under strong creative rules : How do they acquire information regarding their surroundings, and how do they react to it while taking in consideration the player’s situation, without hindering his experience. This presentation will show us how striking a balance between purely systemic solutions and constrained player-centric rules is key to obtain a satisfying result that makes sense from the player’s perspective.</p>
