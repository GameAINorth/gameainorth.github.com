									<p class="session-text">For Guerrilla, Horizon Zero Dawn was a massive change in direction. Transitioning from the level-based, tactical, first person shooter genre to open world, action RPG required us to develop many new systems and to redesign existing ones. In this session we will describe the challenges we faced when developing the AI for Horizon Zero Dawn and the solutions we chose. Some of the subjects we will cover are navigation for agents of varying size in a dynamic environment, how we use a combination of HTN planning and utility based decision making, and the systems we developed to coordinate groups of agents.</p>

								<div class="col-md-12 text-left content">
									<p class="session-text">This presentation provides a practical look into how Warpzone Studios is building a game with autonomous agents on an Entity Component Systems architecture. Specifically it will delve into how the AI fits into that. The presentation will also go into detail about how a tile-based, platformer-style map with destructible terrain affects decision making, path finding and movement. Moddability has been a large focus on the development of the engine and the game architecture. The talk will show how all parts of the AI are extensible.</p>

We present a hierarchical path planning algorithm for finding a progressively more detailed path between two points.

								<div class="col-md-12 text-left content">
									<p class="session-text">Reinforcement Learning (RL) has long been popular in academic research on game AI, but is much less commonly applied to AAA games. This talk will present an initiative within Ubisoft Montreal to use RL as a tool for game productions, by building agents that are able to play (parts of) the game during its development. Preliminary results for two applications will be shown: learning a fighting AI in For Honor to assist with game balancing and new character development, and learning a driving AI in Watch_Dogs to help reach realistic behavior with a large variety of vehicles. The talk will cover the challenges we faced when applying state-of-the-art RL algorithms to modern games, the main lessons learned, and how this project was actually helpful (or not) to designers, testers and programmers on the production floor. And, as a bonus, you may expect videos of games that look better than Pong or Doom for a change!</p>

However, there are many challenges in both design and programming that we had to tackle to accomplish this goal. We had to find a way to make every AI do something coherent beyond player centric reactions at all time, make our reaction system adapt more based on what our AI previously experienced and make the search loop more about outsmarting a group rather singular AIs.</p>

								<div class="col-md-12 text-left content">
									<p class="session-text">There are no weight classes in game development.  There’s no division to keep the fights fair.  You, your team, or your studio are going to be competing with games from vastly different team sizes, with vastly different budgets.  You can use UI, AI, and performance tricks to make your games stand out among those from Goliath teams. In Race for the Galaxy, our neural network creates its own training data with which to hone itself. We run our AIs on a separate thread, to keep framerate up while it's executing. We conduct the flow of UI events through locking attention tokens to make a complex system intuitive. A few smart innovations can give a small team the edge to stand out in the ring.</p>

										<p class="speaker-bio">Theresa Duringer is the cofounder of Temple Gates Games, the studio behind Race for the Galaxy for iOS/Android.  She has been exploring UX/AI/UI particularly in the social spaces of digital boardgames.  She got her start in the boardgame space creating Ascension VR, based on the deckbuilding tabletop game from Stone Blade.  Up next she is partnering again with Rio Grande Games bringing Roll for the Galaxy to iOS and Android.  Before hopping on board the hype-train of futurism between AI and VR, she created Cannon Brawl, an artillery RTS for XBOX, PS4 and PC and worked at Maxis on titles including Spore, Sim City and the Sims.</p>
