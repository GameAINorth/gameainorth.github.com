	"description": "This presentation provides a practical look into how a game with autonomous agents can be built on an Entity Component Systems architecture. It will also show how to build a tile-based, dynamic, platformer-style map where agents can smoothly traverse it using many different methods of movement. The game runs on an inhouse C/C++ engine and it will be shown how all parts of the AI has been built with performance and user moddability in mind.",
