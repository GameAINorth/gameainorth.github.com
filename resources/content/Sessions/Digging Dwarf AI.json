	"description": "This presentation provides a practical look into how Warpzone Studios is building a game with autonomous agents on an Entity Component Systems architecture. Specifically it will delve into how the AI fits into that. The presentation will also go into detail about how a tile-based, platformer-style map with destructible terrain affects decision making, path finding and movement. Moddability has been a large focus on the development of the engine and the game architecture. The talk will show how all parts of the AI are extensible.",
