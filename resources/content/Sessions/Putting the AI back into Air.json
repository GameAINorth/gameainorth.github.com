	"description": "In this talk, we explain the technology behind the aerial navigation in Horizon Zero Dawn. In Horizon, we've represented the flyable air space by use of a run-time generated height map.
Queries can be done on this height map for positional information and navigation. We present a hierarchical path planning algorithm for finding a progressively more detailed path between
two points. Additionally, we will touch on some gameplay related subjects, to show the additional challenges we faced in implementing the different flying behaviors, such as transitioning
from air to ground and guided crash-landing.",
