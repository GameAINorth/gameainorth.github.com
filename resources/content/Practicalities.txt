Thank you for attending Game AI North. We cannot wait to see you! Or if the event is over or happening right now: Great seeing you!

While you are at or around the conference, a few practical questions may pop up. You are of-course always welcome to ask any of the crew, but in order to prepare you optimally ahead of time, we prepared this little cheat sheet.


Schedule and Events

You will find a detailed schedule at the back of your badge and on the event banners at the venue. That said, overall both days start with coffee/tea/water at 0900, have a one hour lunch break at 1230/1200, another coffee/tea/water break (for half an hour) at 1530/1500, with content ending at 1700/1630.

Registration is open from 0900 to 1000 on day one - during the initial coffee break. Please remember to bring your ticket (on screen or paper), which will be exchanged for your t-shirt and badge. Press and sponsor staff need to in stead bring ID.

As mentioned during the ticket purchasing process, remember that everyone at the conference are subject to its "code of conduct":http://gameainorth.com/code-of-conduct.html.

After content-end at day one, we will head for socialising, food, and beering - starting at 1800. To better facilitate meetups, we also have a couple of recommendations for pre-event - on the 16th at 1800 and post-event - on the 18th at 1800.


Venue and Transport

The conference takes place at the IT University of Copenhagen. Its address is:
Rued Langgaards Vej 7
2300 Copenhagen S

This puts us within equal range of the Islands Brygge and DR Byen metro stations. That said, given construction in the area, DR Byen is probably a shorter path. Alternatively, bus access is available via route 12, 33, and 77. For your optimal route via public transportation, use "Rejseplanen":https://www.rejseplanen.dk/webapp/index.html?language=en_EN

Single- or multi-fare tickets can be purchased at metro and train stations, while busses are only able to sell single-fare tickets (cash-only).

Alternatively, you can buy a "City Pass":https://dinoffentligetransport.dk/citypass or an "anonymous 'Rejsekort' (travel card)":http://www.rejsekort.dk/koeb-rejsekort/salgssteder.aspx?sps=0edb084e941a4ebd878bdd1080538881%7c - note that the latter is available for purchase right in the arrivals hall of Copenhagen Airport.

Should you wish to use taxi in stead, the ITU information desk can book one for you. Alternatively, or when away from the venue, both the taxi.eu app and the local "Moove" (searching for "moove taxi" by "4x48" in your app store) are available.

If you arrive by car, parking is available at the venue at a rate of DKK 15 /hour. Of international car-sharing services, "DriveNow":https://www.drive-now.com/dk/en/copenhagen is available in Copenhagen.

At the venue, sessions are split in two lecture halls - on either side of the main hall. The main hall holds the ITU information desk, the conference registration desk, the sponsor area, session wrap-up area, and lunch area.

As a non-smoking facility, ITU directs smoking to a roof-covered area next to the main building.


Social and Beer

Connecting with your fellow attendees, we recommend using the twitter hashtag "#gain17":https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23gain17 or the game-ai Slack channel of "the same name":https://game-ai.slack.com/messages/gain17.

At the end of day one, we will head to "The Dubliner Downtown":http://thedublinerdowntown.dk around 1800 to socialise. The kitchen will be open until 2200 and the bar until far past bedtime. We will head from the venue in a group (or more likely groups), a few stops by metro to Kongens Nytorv / Kgs Nytorv - a short walk from the bar.

If you decide the join later, the address is:
Ny Ã˜stergade 14
1101 Copenhagen K

To ease meeting up, we recommend using The Dubliner Downtown for meeting pre-conference on the 16th at 1800 and post-conference on the 18th at 1800. Some organisers, speakers, and volunteers are likely to join (possibly a bit later) on both occasions.


Visiting Copenhagen

With few exceptions beyond bus fare and storage lockers, cash is dead in Copenhagen. Generally, all places of business take contactless/chip/magnet VISA cards and some will take MasterCard. More touristy areas will take a greater variance of cards and highly touristy areas may take euros.

Cash can of-course still be used most places, but such transactions are locally quite uncommon. Reflecting, I am pretty sure I have not used any danish cash at least a full year back.

While businesses in the touristy areas of the city will have their card readers prompt for tips, rest assured that all employees are already fully compensated by union-secured salaries. Locals generally do not tip - with the rare exception of absolutely exceptional restaurant service. Should you wish to tip anyway, service staff will commonly still accept with a smile.

Most locals get around by bike or public transportation. Taxis, while easily available, are generally more expensive than in other countries. Jaywalking is less common and veering into the bike lane is highly discouraged.


Further Questions

As mentioned, if you have any questions during the event you are more than welcome to ask anyone wearing a cyan-coloured event t-shirt with the "crew" mark on their sleeve. If out of uniform post-content-schedule, we can be spotted by the "volunteer" and "organiser" badge labels.

Before the event and when we are not around, you can reach us on "twitter":https://twitter.com/gameainorth.
