	"bio": "Olivier is currently part of the analytics team in Ubisoft Montreal’s User Research Lab, where he can have fun with tons of player data to build machine learning models from. It took him a while to get there: after graduating from the Ecole Polytechnique de Paris (2001) and from the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Télécommunications de Paris (2003), he first worked as a research assistant at Université de Montréal. He then decided a Ph.D in machine learning could always be handy, so he started one, and even finished it when Ubisoft offered to hire him in 2012."
