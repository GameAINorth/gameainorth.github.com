	"bio": "Anders is a game programmer and designer with 10 years of professional experience and dozens of hobby games under his belt. As a generalist, he's worked on gameplay, AI, core engine development, network and multiplayer code, UI, tools, optimization and physics. Having worked at ten studios and some high-profile projects, notably Avalanche Studios (Just Cause 2), Rockstar North (GTA 5) and Fatshark (Warhammer: Vermintide), he finally decided to join two old friends at Warpzone Studios as a cofounder. 

Anders ambition as an indie developer is to be close to the creative direction and of his projects, and to improve his skills by doing what he likes the most: learn new things."
