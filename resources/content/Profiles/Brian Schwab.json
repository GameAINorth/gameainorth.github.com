	"bio": "After spending more than 20 years as a gameplay and AI programmer in the game industry, Brian Schwab joined a little Florida company who's mission was not so little: to fundamentally change how humans use and interact with their computers. 
So, while in his past he shipped everything from a simple Sega Genesis jrpg to the international blockbuster Hearthstone at Blizzard, he now runs the Interaction Lab, a systems research group within Magic Leap. In addition to using crazy new hardware to explore interactions from low level to hugely complex, his team also helps bring compelling experience to the forefront of the Magic Leap engineering efforts. 
Throughout this, his mission has never changed: to find fun, interactive experiences and share them with the world."
