Chest - 
	Top should be 5cm from neck seam
	Intent is to run as wide as possible with minimal distance between edges and sleeve seams.
	My measurements on a couple size of t-shirts, seems like 37 cm width might be ideal 
Torso - 
	30 cm tall
	Base should be as close to the bottom seam as possible.
Back -
	Top should be 7cm from neck seam
	Width should be 10 cm

Sleeve - (CREW shirts only)
	Around 8cm tall
	Should be positioned as far down the sleeve as possible.
